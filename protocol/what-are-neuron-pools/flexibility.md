# Flexibility

Collateral in Neuron Option Pools doesn't just sit in wait: it's **sent to Curve's liquidity pools** and **generates yields**, so each expiration the collateral grows and **is higher than the week before**. It not only brings in additional value (~~it ain't much, but it's honest capital efficiency~~), but also **mitigates the possible risks** when writing options.

This helps depositors **gain exposure to additional yield** on top of the options strategy. â€‹
{% endhint %}

More, Neuron pools allow for choosing from several **wrapped protocol tokens** to use as the collateral, creating a **new type of derivative product** - flexible and efficient.
