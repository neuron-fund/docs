# ðŸŽ© Neuron pools | Overview

## Neuron pools

Neuron pools are **on-chain managed products** that automate option writing strategies on _ETH_, _USDT_ or _WBTC_, and _Curve pool deposits_, using the latter as the collateral.

For a primer on **what options are** and how they **can be used** in trading, you can visit either [TastyTrade's excellent crash course](https://tastytrade.thinkific.com/courses/beginner-options-course) or [CoinTelegraph's in-depth crypto option article](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/bitcoin-options-explained).

**Covered call** and **put-selling** [strategies](pool-strategies.md) are available at the time of the Neuron Fund launch, with more strategies\* on the way.&#x20;

Strategies collect weekly premiums and allow for **safely adding up to 15% per year** to an already yield-bearing liquidity deposit, thus making the summarized yield **composable**.

Users can deposit their assets into a smart contract, thus automatically running a specific options strategy, also using **any** yield farming strategy and compose it with an option selling strategy in Neuron Option Pool using wrapped token as collateral to mint options (see fig. above).&#x20;

## Why are Neuron pools disrupting the DeFi landscape?

Users can employ **any** yield farming strategy from a Neuron Liquidity Pool + Curve liquidity deposits and compose it with an option selling strategy in Neuron Option Pool using **wrapped tokens as collateral** to mint options.&#x20;

Another Neuron's feature is choosing from **multiple collaterals** minting an option contract. Think of it as [multi collateral DAI](https://medium.com/myetherwallet/multi-collateral-dai-what-you-need-to-know-344788884bbf), but for options and with more flexibility!

{% hint style="success" %}
This allows for flexibility previously unseen by an average user: one can **diversify their already owned assets** while enjoying **additional yield**, not changing anything in their portfolio. Just applying another yield layer, basically.

**Basically:**

* a user can deposit an asset as collateral,&#x20;
* it's wrapped into a yield-bearing token, while the deposit is locked in Curve, and
* the derivatives are automagically used for option selling.
