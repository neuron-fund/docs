# Fees and distribution

### What are the fees at Neuron Capital?

Right now every pool at Neuron Capital employs a Performance fee equal to 20%.

There are no withdrawal fees.

### How are the proceeds distributed? Is there a chart of some kind?

Actually, yes - we've made a chart for you to better understand the flows of hard-earned minted tokens in Neuron:

Half of the fees collected are automatically sent to our [Treasury](https://zapper.fi/dashboard?address=0x066419eaef5de53cc5da0d8702b990c5bc7d1ab3) when the harvesting bot reinvests the yields. The other half is used to buy more NEURs back from the market - all used to distribute those to AXON holders!
