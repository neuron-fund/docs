# Fees and distribution

### What are the fees at Neuron Capital?

Right now every pool at Neuron Capital employs a Performance fee equal to 20%, and a management fee of 2%.
There are no withdrawal fees.

### How are the proceeds distributed? Is there a chart of some kind?

Actually, yes - we've made a chart for you to better understand the flows of hard-earned minted tokens in Neuron:

Basically, 100% of yields are used to buy NEUR back and distribute it to veNEUR holders.
Half of the fees collected are automatically sent to our [Treasury](https://zapper.fi/dashboard?address=0x066419eaef5de53cc5da0d8702b990c5bc7d1ab3) when the harvesting bot reinvests the yields.
