# Emission

> For the current rate of NEUR emissions, please navigate to [https://neuron.money/app](https://neuron.money/app) and hold your mouse over the TOTAL SUPPLY. You can also see the live circulating supply here.

Neuron Capital is subject to asymptotical token emission with a small-ish inflation inbuilt:

* First week comes a mint of $1,000,000$ NEUR tokens
* Then, each week the emission is subject to 50% reduction, making the total asymptotic tokens' count equal to $\frac{1}{reductionRate}\*startingSupply=\frac{1}{0.5}\*1,000,000=2,000,000$.
* Emission is capped after week 1 at $\geq0.02\ NEUR/block$, or $\approx47650.92\ NEUR/week$, at an effective annual inflation rate of _2.382%._ This had been done to allow for future protocol development.
