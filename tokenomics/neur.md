# ðŸ§  NEUR token

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Please have a look at the [corresponding Medium article](https://medium.com/neuronfund-announcement/neur-token-4c5c6ee4f307) and [our Medium blog](https://medium.com/neuronfund-announcement), where all the announcements and research are put out.

Neuron employs a modified veTokenomics model pioneered at Curve. There are two types of "tokens" - **NEUR** and **veNEUR**. The first one is a **ERC20** token, with the other being a _representation of locked NEUR weighted for the remaining lock time_ - the balance assigned to a user.

## What is NEUR?

### Supply and emission

Max Supply: 200 M

100% minted during the genesis event.

The goal of the distribution is to ensure that the **community has over 50% of voting power** in the protocol. Everything but the NEUR token and DAO itself is deployed upon a DAO decision.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NEUR** is an ERC20 token, starting as a governance token through NEUR time-staking for **veNEUR**. Other functions can be attached to the NEUR token by DAO decision.

#### Community: 53%

* **DAO Treasury Multisig**: 23%, linearly vested over a year. Managed by the DAO-enacted treasury multisig.
* **NEUR** **Incentives For Users**: 30%, rewards for liquidity providers in NEUR pools. In the first year half (15% of Total Supply) is linearly released, $$1/(2^n)$$ is released on year n after the protocol launch.

#### Team and Contributors: 31.35% allocated (47% total)

* **Team**: 25%, developed the protocol and contributed in since earliest days
* **Contributors**: 5% _(1.3% allocated, 3.7% reserved)_, those who aided in development _for more than a year_ before protocol launch
* **Early backers**: 17% _(5.05% allocated, 11.95% reserved)_, early community members who put a lot of time since _more than half a year_ before launch and provided help, vision, connections, resources, and capital necessary for the protocol to succeed long-term.

**Lockup for contributors:** 12 months since project launch, and then linear vesting over two years
