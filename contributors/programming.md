# Programming



You're a rookie \(or not\) developer in search of a project to contribute to? Welcome to Neuron Experience Program! We're keeping a Notion backlog of thoroughly described and analyzed features to implement and bugs to fix along with their priorities and approximate rewards - you can always join us, assign yourself a task, then start implementing it all while asking questions and discussing with our team and other devs.

When finished, you get yourself some GitHub activity \(yeah, those green squares everyone's raving about\), tons of TypeScript/Solidity/SQL experience, rewards \(either NEURs, profit boosts or something else \( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°\) \) along with heaps of satisfaction for being the $qt\pi$ you are and helping DeFi progress!

### Paid Contributor Jobs

This includes:

* Community-run front-end tools, such as the Stats Dashboard and the Neuron Dashboard.
* Contribute to new BSC/Polygon/Solana smart contracts and pools.
* Work on bots for Telegram and Discord.

The contributors are rewarded with NEURs. Payments are done weekly by a community-builder-only multisig.

### How to Contribute

The work is organized using the Notion Builder Board.

* Backlog.
* Kanban board updated regularly during planning.
* Pick up tasks during community-led sprint planning in the \#dev channel.
