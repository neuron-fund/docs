## **Modifying an AXON lock**

If you have any AXONs locked, the website will enable you to 1\) increase your lock amount and/or 2\) extend your lock.

* **Increase Lock Amount**. Clicking here adds NEURs to your existing lock by the amount you input. Your _Balance_ is the amount of unlocked NEURs on your wallet
* **Extend Lock Time**. You may click on the input field and use the calendar tool to select a date, which will be rounded to the nearest AXON epoch \(lasting a week\). You may also use the radio buttons to select an extension period

You will be prompted to confirm a transaction from your MetaMask/Web3 wallet for either of the above actions \(these are separate transactions\).
