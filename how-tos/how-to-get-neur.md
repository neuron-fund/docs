## Earning NEUR

NEUR can be earned as follows:

* Depositing in [Neuron Option Pools](../protocol/what-are-neuron-pools/) and then **staking received share to get NEUR rewards**
* **NEURâ€™s community incentives** vesting follows a yearly halving schedule, linear on every yearly interval. After the first year, half of all incentives are vested. Token amount unlocked after n blocks is described by the following function: $$30,000,000 * (1-1/2^{\dfrac{blocks_{sinceTGE}}{blocks_{year}}})$$â€‹
* Providing liquidity to the **NEUR:ETH** Uniswap pool.
* [locking-neur-for-veneur.md](locking-neur-for-veneur.md "mention"), since Neuron Poolsâ€™ revenue is distributed as NEUR tokens proportionate to userâ€™s veNEUR balance
