# Profit sharing

### How does profit sharing in Neuron work?

**50% of the protocol's revenues** \(gross income, basically $DistributedNEUR=PoolRevenue\*\frac{PerformanceFee}{100}\*50\%$ currently amounting to 10%\) is distributed weekly in market-bought NEURs. The amount that a user is entitled to is determined by their proportional share of the total AXON supply multiplied by the number of NEURs that are distributed weekly, e.g. $\frac{UserAXON}{TotalAXON}\*DistributedNEUR$.
