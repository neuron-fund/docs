# ðŸ’° Profit sharing

{% hint style="success" %}
veNEUR holders are entitled to a share of [Neuron Pools](../protocol/what-are-neuron-pools/)â€™ revenue proportional to the **veNEUR** balance.
{% endhint %}

## How does profit sharing in Neuron work?

**A hefty part of the protocol's revenue** is distributed in market-bought NEURs (more on our [distribution and fees](../tokenomics/fees-and-distribution.md)).

The amount that a user is entitled to is determined by their proportional share of the total veNEUR supply multiplied by the number of NEURs that are distributed weekly, e.g. $$DistributedNEUR_{User}=Revenue_{Time\ Period}*\frac{veNEUR_{User}}{veNEUR_{Total}}$$

## How do I claim my pending NEUR rewards?

Users can claim their rewards on the veNEUR page.
