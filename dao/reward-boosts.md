# Reward boosts

## Boosting

One of the main incentives for AXON is the ability to boost your NEUR rewards on our Neuron Pools \([https://app.pickle.finance/farms](https://app.pickle.finance/farms)\). Depositors are able to earn a **max boost of up to 2.5x**.

The following considerations govern how much of a boost you obtain:

* Your proportional **share of the total AXON supply**
  * If you own a larger share of the total supply, you will obtain a larger boost.
* Your proportional **share of a particular Pool**
  * If your deposit in a particular Pool is small relative to the total deposits, it will be easier for you to obtain the max boost. The opposite is true if you comprise a large share of the deposits in a Farm \(i.e. more AXON is needed for max boost\).
  * e.g. if the total deposits in a Pool is $100,000 a smaller AXON balance is required to obtain the max boost if your deposit size was $1,000 compared to if your deposit size was $20,000.

In summary, your AXON balance applies to all Pools equally but may produce different boosts of up to 2.5x based on your share of deposits in the Farm.

1. $DerivedBalance=UserBalanceInFarmâˆ—0.4$
2. $AdjustedBalance = \frac{TotalDepositedInFarm \* UserAXONBalance}{AXONTotalSupply} \*0.6$
3. $BoostFactor = \frac{min\(DerivedBalance +AdjustedBalance, UserBalanceInFarm\)}{UserBalanceInFarm}$

A calculator is provided here to estimate how much AXON is required for obtaining certain boosts given the specific conditions of each of the Pools [http://app.pickle.finance/dill](http://app.pickle.finance/dill).

### Reward Range

You may notice that each Pool displays an APR _range_. Which APR, within the range, you will receive works as follows:

* If you have no AXON balance, you will receive the APR at the lower end of the range. This is the **base APR** that all unboosted users receive.
* If you hold AXON, you will receive a **boosted APR**. Your current boost can be checked with the calculator [here](http://app.pickle.finance/dill).
* The higher end of the range displayed on each Pool shows the APR with the 2.5x boost.
* Once you stake your pTokens in the Pool, your exact APR will be displayed next to the APR range on the "my APR" indicator.
