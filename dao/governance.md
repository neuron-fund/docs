## On-chain governance

On-chain governance relates to the determination of **Pool weights**, which is done autonomously by aggregating votes on the `GaugeDistributor` contract, and is performed automatically.&#x20;

**Pool weights** determine how much of the continuous NEUR rewards the stakers of each Pool get.

## Snapshot (gasless, off-chain) voting

All other matters pertaining to the Neuron protocol, including the selection of protocol officers (e.g. multi-sig members), the budget of the core team, grants and Treasury matters, enhancements, and strategic decisions are taken by the Neuron Fund community under the direction of the founding and developer team.

In order to increase participation, a gasless voting via [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) will be used, which is integrated via Web3 with users' veNEUR balances at a pre-set point-in-time (i.e. a snapshot).

### Submitting a Neuron Improvement Proposal (NIP)

Currently, there is no quorum to launch **Neuron Improvement Proposals** (NIPs), the main mechanism for deciding on changes in the protocol. The standard process instead involves creating a thread on our forum at [https://forum.neuronfund.io](https://forum.neuronfund.io/) with a poll and obtaining enough votes to proceed that a core member would assign it a NIP number and submit it to a governance vote. Everything in details below:

This is a subjective process for the time being as meta-governance is worked out. There are no strict deadlines and vote numbers to proceed.
{% endhint %}

Users should post their proposals on the governance forum to gauge the interest of the overall Neuron Fund community, via [Discord, Telegram and/or the Governance forum](../reference/links.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no minimum veNEUR balance required to vote. Voting on NIPs will be conducted off-chain our Snapshot instance&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once sufficient interest and technical details are ironed out, team members may submit a Snapshot proposal for veNEUR holders to vote on.
