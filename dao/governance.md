# Governance

### The $AXON DAO aka Neuron's on-chain governance

On-chain governance via $AXON relates to the determination of **Pool weights**, which is done autonomously by aggregating votes on the `GaugeDistributor` contract. Pool weights determine how much of the continuous $NEUR rewards the stakers of each Pool get.

To vote, you need to hold $AXON which you can obtain by [vote-locking your $PICKLEs](https://www.notion.so/dill/dill-vote-locking).

**1 AXON = 1 Vote**. Off-chain snapshot voting will continue to be held at [https://snapshot.page/\#/pickle](https://snapshot.page/#/pickle).

Once you have some $AXON safe and secured for long \(hopefully\):

* head over to [app.pickle.finance/farms](https://app.pickle.finance/farms) and expand on the "Vote" element.

The "Vote" element is where you select your desired Farm weights

There is no minimum voting power required to vote.

* select a pool or multiple from the dropdown menu. Once you have completed your selection click outside the dropdown.
* For each pool, input the desired weight. For example, you may input 80% for Pool A and 20% for Pool B. You can input any combination, for as many farms as you like, as long as the total adds up to 100%.
* Click on "Submit Vote" and confirm the transaction with your MetaMask/Web3 wallet.

The votes will be tallied at the end of the $AXON epoch \(lasting one week\), votes from wallets with more $AXON will have a more profound impact on the final Farm weights, as 1 $AXON = 1 vote. Basically it's a voting power-weighted voting mechanism!

### Snapshot \(gasless, off-chain\) voting

All other matters pertaining to the Neuron protocol, including the selection of protocol officers \(e.g. multi-sig members\), the budget of the core team, grants and Treasury matters, enhancements, and strategic decisions are taken by the Neuron community under the direction of the founding and core team.

In order to increase participation, a gasless voting method will be used, which is integrated via Web3 with users' $AXON balances at a pre-set point-in-time \(i.e. a snapshot\).

#### Submitting a Neuron Improvement Proposal \(NIP\)

Currently, there is no quorum to launch **Neuron Improvement Proposals** \(NIPs\), the main mechanism for deciding on changes in the protocol. The standard process instead involves launching a Request for Comments \(RFC\) on the [forum.pickle.finance](https://forum.pickle.finance/) with a poll and obtaining enough votes to proceed that a core member would assign it a NIP number and submit it to a governance vote. This is a subjective process for the time being as meta-governance is worked out.

Users should draft and post the proposal on the governance forum to gauge the interest of the overall Neuron community, via Discord, Telegram and/or the Governance forum.

There is no minimum $AXON balance required to vote. Voting on NIPs will be conducted off-chain our Snapshot instance, [signal.pickle.finance](https://signal.pickle.finance/).

Once sufficient interest and technical details are ironed out, team members may submit a snapshot proposal for AXON holders to vote on.
