\
**Last Updated:** June 9, 2022

\
These Terms of Service (these “**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Neuron website available at [https://neuronfund.io](https://neuronfund.io/) (the “**Website**”) and Neuron Application (App) accessible at https://neuronfund.io/app (the “**App**”, and collectively with the Website, the “**Platform**”).

The Platform is provided by Neuron Investments Ltd, a company established under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, having a registered office located at Intershore Chambers, PO Box 4342, Road Town, Tortola, VG1110 British Virgin Islands (“**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**” or “**Company**”) to be primarily used as a web-based interface to access and use the Neuron Protocol — a set of autonomous smart-contracts implemented on blockchain, as defined below — in a user-friendly and easily comprehensible manner.

By accessing or using the Platform, connecting your Digital Wallet (as defined below) to the App, or by clicking the button “I accept” or respective check box in connection with or relating to these Terms, you (“**you**”, “**your**”) acknowledge that you have read, accept without modifications and agree to be bound by these Terms and all terms incorporated herein by reference, which form a legally binding agreement between you and us.

If you do not accept or agree to these Terms, you are not allowed to access or use the Platform, and must immediately discontinue any use thereof. If you are acting for or on behalf of an entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you are authorised to accept these Terms and enter into a binding agreement with us on such entity’s behalf, and you accept these Terms both on behalf of such entity and on your own behalf.

Please read these Terms carefully as they affect your obligations and legal rights. Note that Sections 22 and 23 contain provisions governing the choice of law, arbitration terms, and class action waiver. Please read and review Sections 15, 17, and 18 carefully before accepting these Terms as they provide for the limitation of liability, your obligations to indemnify the Company Parties, and contain a disclaimer of warranties with regard to the Platform and related software.

“**Option**” means an option on the respective Digital Asset.

“**Platform**” means the Website and App, as defined in the preamble of these Terms, including related software, applications and components provided by the Company. It is expressly acknowledged that the Platform does not include the Neuron Protocol, Third-Party Content, Third-Party Services, and Digital Assets that we neither control nor operate.

“**Prohibited Jurisdiction**” means any of the following jurisdictions: Republic of Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Islamic Republic of Iran, Syrian Arab Republic, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, or Sevastopol, and any jurisdiction in which the use of the Platform is prohibited by applicable laws or regulations.

“**Strategies**” means certain terms of the liquidity provision and Option selling established within the Protocol.

The terms “option”, “derivative”, “investment”, and other similar terms, as may be used herein, on the Platform or in materials provided by us or on our behalf, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of a decentralised smart-contract system and the discretionary performance of traditional off-chain transactions by people. When the App is used to access the Neuron Protocol, there are no legal agreements, promises of payment, or courts of law, and therefore there are no options, derivatives, investments, or other traditional transactions involved.

**2. MODIFICATION**

We may modify, supplement or update these Terms from time to time at our sole and absolute discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will notify you of such changes by updating these Terms and the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. We may further (but will not be obligated to) provide an additional notification of the amendment via one of the communication channels specified in Section 24 of these Terms. Unless otherwise notified by us, updated Terms shall be effective immediately, and your continued use of the Platform will confirm the acceptance of such updated Terms. If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must immediately discontinue any access to or use of the Platform.

**3. NEURON PROTOCOL VS APP**

The Neuron Protocol is essentially a set of smart-contracts implemented on the Ethereum blockchain and, from time to time, other blockchain networks that allow for participating in certain option selling and yield farming strategies (the “**Neuron Protocol**”). The App is a web-hosted user interface that allows you to access and utilise the functionality of the Neuron Protocol. Although the App serves as a means of interacting with the Neuron Protocol, the App is distinct from the Neuron Protocol and constitutes independent software. The Neuron Protocol is a peer-to-peer decentralised and autonomous blockchain protocol that we do not control, manage or operate.

A more detailed description of the App and Neuron Protocol is provided in the Documentation, which does not form a part of these Terms and is provided for the information purposes only. The use or other interaction with the Neuron Protocol is subject to certain limitations and restrictions outlined in the Documentation.

The Neuron Protocol is composed of open-sourced smart-contracts. These smart-contacts can be reviewed, verified, used, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone (subject to the terms of the applicable licence). Accordingly, there might be other interfaces enabling interaction with the Neuron Protocol that we neither manage nor are affiliated with. Furthermore, anyone can interact directly with the Neuron Protocol smart-contracts bypassing the App and other interfaces.

You should carefully and thoroughly review and assess the Neuron Protocol and related software before you use them, and any such use shall be at your own risk. You should always do your own research.

You further acknowledge that we do not control the Neuron Protocol, its underlying blockchain network(s), and any software through which such networks are formed. Accordingly, in no event shall we be responsible for or held liable in connection with the Neuron Protocol, underlying blockchain networks or software, their operation, functioning, implementation, or use, and you hereby assume and accept any and all related risks, including the risk of possible losses and damages that you may incur in connection with the use thereof.

**4. CONNECTING DIGITAL WALLET**

When using the App, you may connect your Digital Wallet through one of the compatible third-party software wallets, such as, for illustration purposes only, MetaMask, TrustWallet, WalletConnect or similar software. The Digital Wallets constitute the Third-Party Services and we are not responsible for, do not endorse, shall not be held liable or responsible in connection with, and do not make any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the software digital wallets used by you with the App. When using Digital Wallets, you should review applicable terms and policies that govern your use thereof.

We never receive access to or control over your Digital Wallets or Digital Assets held in such Digital Wallets. Therefore, you are solely responsible for securing your Digital Assets, Digital Wallet and credentials thereto. You may disconnect your Digital Wallet from the App at any time.

**5. ELIGIBILITY**

To be eligible to access and use the App, you must:

1. be able to form a legally binding agreement with us on terms herein set forth;
2. use the App not as a consumer (a person using services for personal or household purposes) as defined under the applicable legislation;
3. neither be a Prohibited Person nor use the Platform for the benefit of a Prohibited Person;
4. if individual, be at least 18 (eighteen) years of age, or of such higher age required to enter into a binding agreement with us on the terms set out herein according to the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside; and
5. comply with these Terms.

**6. LICENCE**

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we hereby grant you a limited, temporary, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable licence (right) to access and use the Platform for its intended purposes on the terms set forth herein (the “**Licence**”). The Licence will remain effective until terminated on the terms contained herein.

To the extent that certain items or components of the Platform or Neuron Protocol are being distributed under an Open-Source Licence, such items and components will not be covered by the Licence granted hereunder and will be provided to you under the terms and conditions of the applicable Open-Source Licence.

The Licence granted hereunder shall terminate and cease upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

1. these Terms terminate or expire;
2. you violate these Terms;
3. we choose to terminate the Licence at our sole and absolute discretion, with or without reason.

Your access and use of the Platform shall not violate the terms of the Licence and/or Open-Source Licences, if and as applicable.

**7. DISCLAIMERS**

You hereby acknowledge and agree that we do not provide any custodial or similar services, custodial solutions or software, do not act as your agent or representative, and do not control, manage or custody any of your Digital Assets or Digital Wallets.

We shall not be responsible for or held liable in connection with any operations carried out by you, any other user or group of users through or with the use of the Neuron Protocol, whether through the App or otherwise, including any transfer, delivery, use, or storing of Digital Assets. We shall not be acting as an intermediary in any transaction nor shall we be responsible for ensuring that any transaction made through the App or otherwise on a blockchain network is actually completed or performed. We do not control or influence transactions with Digital Assets, and therefore we are unable to cancel, reverse, block, or freeze any transactions conducted by you or any other user of the App.

We are not your broker, fund manager, or any intermediary to any broker or fund manager. Neither the App nor the Neuron Protocol or anything in these Terms shall be considered as a broker and/or fund management services, or any intermediation services thereto.

Neither we nor any part of the Platform provide financial advisory, legal, regulatory, or tax services directly, indirectly, implicitly, or in any other manner, and you should not consider any information contained in these Terms, on the Platform or in the Documentation to be a substitute for professional financial, legal, regulatory, tax, or other advice. You shall not rely upon the data displayed in the App or provided in the Documentation when taking any decision, and shall conduct your own independent investigation and research before making any transaction involving the Digital Assets.

The Platform, including any information and materials available thereon, is not intended to constitute an offer of securities, financial instruments, Digital Assets, or a solicitation for investment in or purchase of securities, financial instruments, or Digital Assets in any jurisdiction, nor is it intended to constitute a prospectus or offer document of any type. We do not provide any opinion or any advice to purchase, sell, or otherwise transact with the Digital Assets, and nothing communicated by us shall form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Please consult your own legal or financial advisor before making any decision.

We neither control nor influence the Strategies, which are deemed the Third-Party Services. We do not endorse any of the Strategies and it shall be your responsibility to evaluate the Strategies. We shall not be responsible for or held liable in connection with any Strategies, you, any other user, or group of users with the use of the App or through the Neuron Protocol, including any receipt, transfer, use, or storing of the Digital Assets.

Any Disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Platform, including any question regarding the existence, validity, or termination of these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the binding arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. Any arbitration will occur in London, UK. You will not and hereby waive your rights to object to the arbitration prescribed herein.

Unless otherwise required by the applicable law, and to the maximum extent permitted and possible, you, Company, and the arbitrators shall maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Disputes. Unless prohibited under the law, the arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality.

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and us and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding in any circumstances. There will be no class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration where an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

To the maximum extent permitted under the law, you and we waive the rights to a jury trial, class action arbitration, and to have any Dispute resolved in court.

To the maximum extent permitted under the law, you and we hereby agree that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Platform shall be filed within one (1) year after the ground for such claim arose; if the claim is not filed within this term, such claim shall be permanently barred, which means that neither you, nor we will have the right to assert such claim.
