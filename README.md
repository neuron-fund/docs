# ðŸ‘€ Product overview

## What is Neuron

DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, opens opportunities for gaining returns on crypto-investments. There are many parts of DeFi, including lending platforms, liquidity protocols, stock synthetics, automated market makers, derivatives, and more. Unfortunately, there isn't an abundance of protocols aiming to **increase capital efficiency, using assets one already owns.**

**Neuron Fund** is an innovative on-chain derivatives DeFi protocol that leverages web3 technology to deliver attractive performance on user's deposits and composes **option selling strategies** with **yield farming** to increase capital efficiency. Neuron's been [thoroughly audited](tokenomics/security.md#pessimistic-security) by a top-notch security firm.

## How does Neuron work? What are the use cases?

![](<.gitbook/assets/NEUR Flow (1).png>)

Neuron currently offers two main products and a locking system for additional yield:

### Users

* [neuron-options.md](protocol/neuron-options.md "mention") are multicollateralized for increasing option strategies profitability (since every covered short position can gain yield)
* ****[**Neuron pools**](protocol/what-are-neuron-pools/) **** are an evolutionary step forward for derivative on-chain products and enable adding up to 15% APY running automated derivative strategies on a vast range of assets, including Curve liquidity deposits. In simple LaTeX terms: $$Total\ APY_{Option\ Pool} =Liquidity\ Yield_{(Curve)}+Yield_{Option\ Writing}$$.
* [vote-locking.md](tokenomics/vote-locking.md "mention") NEUR for veNEUR: possibility of receiving a share of protocol revenue and voting rights

### Market makers

Market makers can buy option contracts (noTokens) at Neuron's open auctions weekly, usually at a discount to the market price.

### Protocols

Protocols can add their tokens to liquidity mining and/or Neuron option pools to increase their adoption and TVL - drop us a note @ [hello@neuronfund.io](mailto:hello@neuronfund.io).

## Social

We've established some media volumes for Neuron; you can find them in our [links.md](reference/links.md "mention") section.

## Governance aka veNEUR DAO

Neuron is governed and owned by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).&#x20;

Holders of _veNEUR_, a representation of NEUR token that has been [time-locked on the platform](tokenomics/vote-locking.md) for a set duration, [receive voting rights](dao/governance.md) along with potentially participating in the protocol's [revenue sharing](dao/profit-sharing.md).
