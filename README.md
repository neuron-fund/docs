# Intro

## What is Neuron Fund

Decentralised Finance had experienced exponential growth during the last year's craze, going strong at more than $60,000,000,000 locked funds. There are many parts of DeFi, including lending platforms, liquidity protocols, stock synthetics, automated market makers, and more. Yield aggregators are another option in the Decentralized Finance space.

Yield farming is hard. There are many projects offering high returns, but it's tough to know if they're sustainable or if they are projects that you can trust. Two more points:

A Providing liquidity is boring for everyone and complicated for off-chain investors

B. High-yield and **provably** safe investing as the goal

Neuron Fund jumps from A to B with **automation, risk analysis** and **tokenomics design.** We're always on the lookout for opportunities to generate yield on your assets for all risk tolerance levels.

## How does it work?

Neuron Fund consists of two investing instruments:

* **Pools**, which are essentially automating the investing process, including LP position provisioning
* **Staking** NEUR for AXON: receiving a share of protocol revenue, boosted rewards, and voting rights

## Social

We've established some media volumes for Neuron, you can find them in our [Social](https://www.notion.so/Social-38ac7bbd4f764542b45259566b51154a) section:

* Discord - the official channel for Neuron discussions \[Discord link\]

* Telegram \[Tlg link\]
* Feedback: \[Canny/other feature req link\]

## Governance aka veNEUR DAO

Neuron capital is governed by a DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\). Holders of “veNEUR”, a representation of NEUR token that has been time-locked on the platform for a set duration, receive voting rights to make changes to the protocol, emissions, and more.

#### **What are the risks?**

Neuron Fund smart contracts have been [audited](tokenomics/security.md). We're running a constant bug bounty program, additionally.

There is also a slim chance that the price of NEUR goes to 0, however that's hugely offset by our tokenomics' incentivization mechanisms. Only invest what you can afford to lose \(that's an investment maxim to always follow\) and do your own due diligence.

#### Can't I do the Neuron Fund functions myself?

Yes you could, but the pools help you automatically re-invest your rewards to increase your principal, save on gas and optimize for the highest yielding strategies.

**Where are the Smart Contracts?**

All of the deployed smart contracts used by Neuron Fund are available at our Github: [https://github.com/avele/Neuron-Contracts](https://github.com/avele/Neuron-Contracts) and also at [Deployment addresses](reference/deployment-addresses.md)

#### **What are Neuron's tokenomics?**

There is no hard cap on the supply of NEURs, however the emission is asymptotical. The emission schedule can be found [here](tokenomics/emission.md).
