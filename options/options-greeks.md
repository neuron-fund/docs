### **Delta**

**Delta** is a measure of option priceâ€™s sensitivity to a one-point move in assetâ€™s price (mathematically itâ€™s the first derivative of an optionâ€™s price): _Î”OptionPrice/$1(AssetPrice)_

### **Gamma**

**Gamma** is logically (it goes after delta), a second derivative. It denotes changes in delta per one point of assetâ€™s price: _Î”Delta/$1(AssetPrice)_

### Theta

**Theta:** an immensely important greek. Itâ€™s how much an option changes in price per day, and it goes down as expiration moves closer. Below is a basic chart of an optionâ€™s value decaying.

### Vega

**Vega** is optionâ€™s sensitivity to an underlying assetâ€™s change in volatility. Usually, higher near the strike price recedes nearing expiration. A great visualization by QC is below:
