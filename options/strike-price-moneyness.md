# ðŸŽ³ Strike price, moneyness

The **strike price** of an option is the price a put or call option can be exercised at. It is also known as the exercise price. [Picking strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021014/options-basics-how-pick-right-strike-price.asp) is one of two key decisions (the other being time to expiration) an investor or trader must make when selecting a specific option. Strike price has an enormous bearing on how an option trade will play out.

Another important parameter is optionâ€™s **moneyness**:

It should be noted that an **ITM (in-the-money)** option is in an overwhelming majority of cases priced higher than an **OTM (out-of-the-money)** one. Itâ€™s not in the least because of intrinsic value (Value at expiration on the chart above) â€” as opposed to extrinsic value catching the not-so-obvious part of an optionâ€™s premium (**time value** and **volatility**/proneness to big price moves), this oneâ€™s easy: itâ€™s the absolute difference between an optionâ€™s strike price and current asset price: |_StrikePrice-AssetPrice_|.&#x20;
