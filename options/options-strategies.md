# ♟ Options strategies

There are a total of 4 basic option strategies:

* Bought (**long**) **call** option
* Sold (**short**) **call** option
* **Long put** option
* **Short put** option

Now, it’s time to move on to the next (and maybe the main) thing to understand options: **payoff diagrams**. These are mathematical charts with a quirk: _x_ axis is the asset’s price, and _y_ denotes the user’s profit or loss. Let’s delve into those!

## Complex (spread) option strategies <a href="#6383" id="6383"></a>

It’s paramount to say that anything that can be combined (say, peanut butter & jelly, or doing a short transaction on a call option — do you recall it being a sale of a right to buy the asset?) can be combined on a higher level; option positions are no exception. Positions with different option types, strike prices, expiration dates can be combined for an **almost infinite amount of possibilities** — options trading is in essence [like playing chess](https://steadydime.com/blog/how-trading-options-is-like-playing-chess), art as much as a science: there’s an **optimal position for every situation.**

A guide on complex option strategies, called **spreads** (an individual position in a spread is called a **leg** — so legs should be spread wide, ahem, diversified!), for the interested can be found at [O’Reillys Bible of Options strategies](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-bible-of/0131710664/app01.html).
