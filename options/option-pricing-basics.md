Don‚Äôt mind the typo in the risk-free rate (oops, now you‚Äôve seen it), WSMojo‚Äôs done an awesome job at explaining the constituents! So, while intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the underlying asset price, the extrinsic part is the option‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù, almost-tangible value comprised of its time and volatility values.

Think of it the following way ‚Äî you‚Äôre either buying **an insurance policy** or selling it (as an insurance company); time value would be the **length of your policy**, and your **coverage** will be \~volatility value. So, you‚Äôre invested in the **ability to make a choice now or in the future** (but only if you‚Äôre American! Not an offense, please refer to option styles above).

If something can be calculated at scale, it needs an input and an output.
