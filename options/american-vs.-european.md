# ðŸŒŽ American vs. European

[**American and European**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/american-european-options.asp) **options** are [mostly identical](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) apart from one point: owners of American-style options may exercise it at any time before the option expires. On the other hand, European-style options may be exercised only at expiration.

{% hint style="warning" %}
American options are usually a wee bit more expensive compared to their european counterparts - you're basically paying for [preserving optionality](https://fs.blog/preserving-optionality/).
