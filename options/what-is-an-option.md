# ⏳ What is an option?

A vanilla option contract is an **agreement** between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction (purchasing or selling) on some underlying asset at a preset price, referred to as the **strike price**, prior to the **expiration date**.

A call option is a **right to purchase** some asset, and a **right to sell** is a put option.

Options **expire on Fridays** — to make for a wonderful, stress-free (or the opposite) weekend; crypto markets, despite trading 24/7, usually respect this tradition. An option can be exercised, e.g. the right to buy/sell is literally exercised by the contract’s owner, leading to a transaction.

An option contract may be **bought** and **sold** (for a price, of course — it’s usually called an option’s premium) — with the latter meaning one is being the counterparty: if someone exercises a call option, they will get the asset while the seller will be obliged to sell it (or do a [short sell](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) — borrow it for a fee to sell; an obligation’s an obligation, after all). Vice versa for put options: one exercising the option sells the asset with put-seller being assigned; however, an option seller captures the premium on accepting the deal.
