#### Step 1

Navigate to [https://app.pickle.finance/jars](https://app.pickle.finance/jars) and choose your blockchain - ETH/BSC/others; this will determine the pools available. We're always on the way to add more - Polygon and Solana soon!

#### Step 2

Assuming you had your wallet connected, select the Pool you wish to earn yield on. They are opened by an accordion slider.

#### Step 3

Enter your desired deposit amount. You can use the buttons `1/4`, `1/2` or `MAX` to modify the investment based on your wallet's balance.

After the transaction is complete, another transaction will pop-up so you can actually “Deposit” the tokens.

You can always pay attention to our nifty status on the Deposit button, by the way! All intuitive and for your convenience.

Congratulations, you have successfully deposited your tokens in a nPool. This means your tokens are earning yield using the Pool's strategy.

The transaction will have provided you with some "p" tokens. These tokens represent your deposit with Neuron and can be redeemed for your deposited LP tokens at any time.
